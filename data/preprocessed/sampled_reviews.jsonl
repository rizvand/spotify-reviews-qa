{"review_text": "The latest update removes the ability to view your saved music by artist. You can only view your music if you have saved the full album, or created a playlist.

{"review_text": "I used to love Spotify but the new update is not it. I can't add song's to queue,no play next option anymore,can't play a full playlist (after one or two songs it skips to recommended/suggested songs when I really don't want to listen to them. I wanna play my curated playlist!!), I can't turn off shuffle anymore(That was one of the best features but it's now only available in premium), can't pause, rewind, loop. Honestly I'm so fed up with Spotify. I have to look at other streaming options now.", "review_rating": 1, "review_likes": 5195, "author_app_version": "8.8.48.523", "review_timestamp": "2023-06-30 07:00:21"}

{"review_text": "Editing my review after 3 years: They have made it mandatory to purchase a premium subscription to skip to your favorite part of a song, and you can't replay it while playing. These are basic features of a music app, but now you have to pay for them. So bad. Free music with ads is still tolerable and understandable, but this stunt is so cheap. I have been using Spotify for about 3 years and considered it the finest music app. But no, it's absolutely disgusting now. Uninstalling it on the way.", "review_rating": 1, "review_likes": 4642, "author_app_version": "8.8.78.587", "review_timestamp": "2023-10-23 12:08:07"}
{"review_text": "I use to LOVE Spotify. Paid for premium for years and use it daily. but for the last month now without missing a day, it will just stop playing mid song. its not being used elsewhere, I'm not using my phone and it is random as to when it will do it during my listening session. could be 2 songs in or 6 songs in or do it every single song in a row. doesnt matter if the playlist is saved to my phone, through my google home, in my car or on the web version on my laptop. it's beyond frustrating.", "review_rating": 1, "review_likes": 4219, "author_app_version": "8.5.6.673", "review_timestamp": "2019-05-17 21:03:08"}
